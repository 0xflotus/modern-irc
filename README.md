# Modern IRC

This is an attempt to create a somewhat updated document about the IRC client protocol these days. Most of it draws from [RFC1459](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1459) and [RFC2812](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2812).

This is **not an authoritative document**, just something that's hopefully useful when writing software. This is not aiming to be an RFC, I'm just trying to get some relatively sane subset of the IRC protocol written down. Look at [ircv3-harmony](https://github.com/kaniini/ircv3-harmony) for something which aims to be a specification.

This covers the client-server protocol only, random bits and pieces cherry-picked from the RFCs, IRCv3, Internet-Drafts, and commands/replies that have generally been accepted by the IRC community.
